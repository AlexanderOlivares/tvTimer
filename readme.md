# ‚è± TV Countdown Timer

#### A voiced countdown timer for TV news producers and directors to countdown anchors and reporters.

### Why make this?

At the TV station I work at our fancy control room timer broke. So I decided to make this site as a replacement. Months after the original timer was fixed, this countdown timer continues to get daily use because of the added perk of having a voice count you down aloud.

### Delay feature

When we count down reporters in the field they hear our count on a delay which can lead to them being cutoff mid-sentence at the end of shows. I created a delay setting on the timer to offset this. When the delay feature is active the voice will countdown early so that when you relay the countdown to the reporter they will hear an accurately timed count. Confusing I know, but it is very useful feature (especially with some anchors working from home during the pandemic).
